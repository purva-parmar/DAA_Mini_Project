This project schedules aircraft landings to avoid runway conflicts and minimize delays.It uses Backtracking to check valid assignments, Dynamic Programming for optimal timing, and a Priority Queue to prioritize emergency flights. The system simulates real airport runway allocation in a simple and efficient manner.
